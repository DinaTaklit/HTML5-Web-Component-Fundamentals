# HTML5 Web Component Fundamentals

- Learn how HTML5 Web Components give us the power to extend the web with our own rich, standards-based components.
- Web developers have been struggling for years to create truly **reusable components**.
- We struggle with styling, bundling, defining templates, and encapsulating our markup and styles from accidental manipulation.
- But HTML5 Web Components provide the power to finally define standards-based, reusable web components through four(04) new technologies.
- Learn how to use the **Shadow DOM** to encapsulate the DOM and styling for your components.
- Define **inert templates** with the template tag.
- Extend HTML by **registering your custom elements**.
- And bundle this all together in a simple **reusable package** using HTML5 **imports**.
